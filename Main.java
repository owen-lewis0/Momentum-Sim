/**
 * This is my momentum simulator
 * You first input initial values for the masses and velocities of two blocks in the terminal
 * Then view the Processing screen to see the simulation
 * You can click the restart button to return both blocks to their initial positions and initial velocities
 * You can click the toggle friction button to turn friction on and off
 * Input a negative value for velocity to make a block move to the left
